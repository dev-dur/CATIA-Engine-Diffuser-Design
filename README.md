## 📘 Overview
This repository showcases the **Engine Diffuser** designed and modeled in **CATIA V5** as part of a personal mechanical design portfolio.  
The diffuser is a key component in jet engines — responsible for slowing down high-velocity airflow and converting kinetic energy into pressure for efficient combustion performance.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a **parametric 3D diffuser model** with optimized curvature and smooth aerodynamic transitions.  
- Ensure a **consistent cross-sectional profile** for airflow stability.  
- Apply **surface and part design** workbenches in CATIA to achieve precision and manufacturable geometry.

## 🧩 Tools & Workbenches Used
- **CATIA V5**  
  - *Part Design*  
  - *Generative Shape Design*  
  - *Sketcher*
